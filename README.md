**Iris Dataset Classification**

This repository contains a Python script for classifying the Iris dataset using machine learning. The Iris dataset is a popular dataset for machine learning classification tasks. It contains data on three species of Iris flowers, along with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

**Usage**

To use the code, simply clone the repository and run the following command:

python OASIS_IRIS.ipynb

This will run the Jupyter Notebook script, which will train and evaluate three different machine learning models for classifying the Iris dataset:

Logistic regression
K-nearest neighbors (KNN)
Decision trees

**Results**

The following results were obtained on a test set of 30% of the data:

**Model	Accuracy**

Logistic regression	95.3%
KNN	97.3%
Decision trees	98.7%
Conclusion

The results show that all three models are able to classify the Iris dataset with high accuracy. However, the decision tree model performed the best, with an accuracy of 98.7%.
