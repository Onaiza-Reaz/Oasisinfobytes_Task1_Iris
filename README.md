Iris Flower Classification

This repository contains a Python script to classify Iris flowers using Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Tree classifiers.

The script uses the Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of Iris flowers from three different species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

To run the script, simply execute the following command:

python iris_classification.py

This will train the three classifiers on the Iris dataset and then evaluate their performance on a test set. The script will output the accuracy of each classifier to the console.

Requirements

Python 3.6 or higher
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-Learn
Usage
To use the script, simply clone the repository to your local machine and then execute the following command:

python iris_classification.py

This will train the three classifiers on the Iris dataset and then evaluate their performance on a test set. The script will output the accuracy of each classifier to the console.
